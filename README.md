# 🚢 Titanic Classification

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building with Python.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and fare.  
- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Prediction on test data

## 🚀 Results
Achieved around **80% accuracy** on the test set.
